# Implement a simple python script using psycopg2 and argparse libraries.
# The script will display the movies from your database based on the userâ€™s preferences.
# The user should be able to perform the following:
# Check whether the movie with specific name is among the top 250 movies.
# If so - display the release year of the movie and the imdb rating
# Display the user all the movies with imdb rating higher than the one provided by the user.
